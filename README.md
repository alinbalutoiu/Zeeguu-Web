# Zeeguu-Web [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zeeguu-ecosystem/Zeeguu-Web.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zeeguu-ecosystem/Zeeguu-Web)

Basic Web Client for the Zeeguu Platform


## About

The Zeeguu ecosystem aims to develop an open API that allows tracking and modeling the progress 
of a learner in a foreign language with the goal of recommending paths to accelerate vocabulary 
acquisition.

The API will offers translations for the words that a learner encounters in his readings. 
The history of the translated words and their context is saved and used to build a dynamic 
model of the user knowledge. The context is used to extract the words the user knows and their 
topics of interest.

Reader recommendations and micro-learning based exercises will help one accelerate vocabulary 
acquisition.

This project represents a simple web interface mainly for account management.  

A deployment of the current state of the system is available online at [https://zeeguu.unibe.ch](https://zeeguu.unibe.ch)
